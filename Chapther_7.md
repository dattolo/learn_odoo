# Administering an Odoo Installation

*... same notes that I image useful for me...*

One of the greatest advantages of Odoo is that it is easy to get up and running with very little setup. **Within just a few minutes, you can have several applications installed and you can begin working with the system right away.**

## Administering users in Odoo

### Understanding groups in Odoo

#### Understanding group rules in Odoo

Sometimes, in a system, you want users to have access to a particular model, but not to all the records in that model.

Odoo provides a pretty good description at the bottom of the form on how rules interact.

The most important part of the rule is the **Rule Definition** or **Domain Filter**.

> When making your own rules, copy and paste rules from a similar rule to
make it easier to get the syntax right.

## Internationalization in Odoo

### Configuring language translation

Odoo has very robust features for configuring a global ERP system that can meet the demands of today's multicultural business environment.

On the other hand, **if you are purchasing from a supplier in an alternative currency, you may choose to create a special price list that allows you to do business in that currency**.

You would use Overwrite Existing Terms if you have made custom modifications to a language translation and now wish to overwrite them.

### Internationalization in Odoo
#### International currencies

Currencies, however, will require more planning and testing during system configuration. Unlike languages, multiple currencies can directly modify the amount of money you are receiving or paying out.


##### Managing supplier price lists

#### Managing sequences in Odoo

To see the current **sequences** defined by Odoo, go to the **Settings | Technical** menu and choose **Sequences**
under **Sequences & Identifiers**.


## Multiple companies in Odoo

Odoo can manage multiple companies within the same database.

**A good general rule is that if a company is not a separate legal entity, then it shouldn't be set up as part of multiple companies in Odoo**

### Implementing a multi-company solution

As we stated previously, setting up a multi-company system is complex.
