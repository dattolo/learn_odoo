# Exploring Customer Relationship Management in Odoo 12

*... same notes that I image useful for me...*

In the past, businesses were centered on specific products, but now the focus has shifted to center the businesses on customers. A **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system provides the tools and reporting necessary *to manage customer information and interactions*.

## Using CRM as a business strategy

It is valuable to briefly discuss the importance of a *comprehensive approach* to implementing a **CRM** system in your business.

The **CRM software systems** are only a technical tool for assisting your sales and marketing department in acquiring and keeping customers.

A **plan** must be implemented to spend time training and encouraging the sharing of knowledge to successfully implement a CRM system.

### Managing customer experience

Making the most of a CRM system requires you *to put yourself in the role of your customer* and develop a **consistent strategy to improve** their overall customer experience.

### Treating your customer like a real person

Instead of treating customers like cattle (bestiame), a smart account manager using a CRM system can greatly personalize the customer experience.

Treat your customer *like an individual* and they will reward you with their loyalty (lealtà).



### Installing the CRM application

#### Your first look at the Odoo CRM pipeline

You are presented with a blank **Pipeline** that will serve as **the primary way to track your opportunities**.

### Assigning the sales representative or account manager

Creating a *salesperson* that will handle standard customer accounts. Note that a sales representative is also a user in the **Odoo system**.

#### Sales application settings

##### User – own documents only

This option offers the most restrictive access to the Sales application.

**They will not be able to see any leads that have been assigned to other salespeople in the Sales application.**

##### User – all documents

Access all documents in **Sales application**.

##### Manager

The Manager setting is the highest access level in the Odoo sales system. With this level of access, a user can see all the leads and access the configuration options of the Sales application.

##### Assigning a salesperson to a customer

Now that we have set up our salesperson, it is time to assign the salesperson their first customer.


## Understanding your pipeline


### An introduction to sales stages

Four stages:
- New;
- Qualified;
- Proposition;
- Won;

As an opportunity moves between stages, the *Kanban* view will update to show you where each opportunity currently stands.

#### Using Odoo's Chatter feature

We will utilize the Chatter feature to demonstrate how to communicate details between team members and generate log entries to document our progress.

The Chatter allows you to see a running *set of logs* of the *transactions* or *operations* that have affected the document.

#### Changing the status of an opportunity

#### Following a business document

#### Closing the sale

#### Your opportunity converted to a quotation

## Leads and opportunities

You can think a **lead** as less critical, and perhaps less likely, to turn into a real sales situation than an opportunity.

An example of an **opportunity** would be if you met someone at a conference and had a detailed conversation about how your company provides appropriate services.

### Turning on leads in Odoo

You can enable leads by first choosing Settings under the Configuration section in the CRM menu.

### Converting a lead into an opportunity
