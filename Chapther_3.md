# Exploring Customer Relationship Management in Odoo 12

*... same notes that I image useful for me...*

In the past, businesses were centered on specific products, but now the focus has shifted to center the businesses on customers. A **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system provides the tools and reporting necessary *to manage customer information and interactions*.

## Using CRM as a business strategy

It is valuable to briefly discuss the importance of a *comprehensive approach* to implementing a **CRM** system in your business.

The **CRM software systems** are only a technical tool for assisting your sales and marketing department in acquiring and keeping customers.

A **plan** must be implemented to spend time training and encouraging the sharing of knowledge to successfully implement a CRM system.

### Managing customer experience

Making the most of a CRM system requires you *to put yourself in the role of your customer* and develop a **consistent strategy to improve** their overall customer experience.

### Treating your customer like a real person

Instead of treating customers like cattle (bestiame), a smart account manager using a CRM system can greatly personalize the customer experience.

Treat your customer *like an individual* and they will reward you with their loyalty (lealt√†).
