# Understanding Project Management

*... same notes that I image useful for me...*

In this chapter, we will explore a very flexible application that allows you to **manage projects** and tie them into other applications in Odoo. The **Project Management application** allows your company to manage **project stages**, **assign teams**, and even **track time** and **job costs** related to projects. Analytical accounting features give you even greater control over how project costs can be tied to your company's general ledger.
