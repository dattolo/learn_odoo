## Gathering requirements

### Implementing Odoo using a modular approach

To manage your Odoo implementation, **you must begin with planning the modules with which you will work first**.

Odoo allows you to install just what you need now and then install additional Odoo modules as you better define your requirements.

>When implementing Odoo for your organization, you will also want to create a basic requirements document.

## Creating a new database in Odoo

### Managing databases in Odoo

The database management interface allows you to perform basic database management tasks such as **backing** up or **restoring** a database.

#### Set up multiple databases

It is also possible to set up multiple databases under the same installation of Odoo. *For instance*, in the future, you may want to install another database that loads demonstration data and may be used **to install modules simply for testing purposes**.

>You can access the database management interface directly by going to the **/web/database/manager path**

## Installing the Sales application

### Knowing the basic Odoo interface

**Discuss messaging app** where your inbox and other communication activities are located.
