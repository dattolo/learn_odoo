# Customizing Odoo for Your Business

You might consider this as an introduction to customization.

## Understanding the Odoo architecture

Each Odoo application has **three primary components** that make up the final
Odoo application. 
The three components are:
- models;
- views;
- actions.

### Models

Models are what hold and manage the data.

### Views

Data that is collected from these models is displayed in your applications using views.


### Actions

Actions are what trigger the appropriate views to be displayed, or for specific actions to take place on a model.

## Adding a custom field to Odoo

### Customizing search operations in Odoo

### Understanding actions

### Creating a new menu

### Integrating applications using Odoo's API

The Odoo API connects Odoo's data from an external application. It utilizes **XML-RPC**, which is a protocol for *remote procedure calls*, and it uses **XML syntax** to connect with the data on an **Odoo server**.
